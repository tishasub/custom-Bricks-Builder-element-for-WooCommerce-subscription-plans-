elements/
  ‚îî‚îÄ‚îÄ class-element-subscription-plans.php  # Main element class

### Adding More Plans
To add additional plans:
1. Add new control group in `set_control_groups()`
2. Add controls in `set_controls()`
3. Add plan data in the `render()` method
4. Update the grid layout if needed

## Troubleshooting

- Ensure Bricks Builder is installed and activated
- Check that the file path in functions.php is correct
- Verify the element file exists in the correct location

### Prices Not Updating
- Confirm WooCommerce product IDs are correct

- Enable dynamic pricing in element settings

### Subscription Not Working
